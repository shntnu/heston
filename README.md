# Heston

Monte Carlo simulations for Black-Scholes and Heston stochastic volatility models.

## Run

```bash
marimo edit bs.py       # Black-Scholes
marimo edit heston.py   # Heston stochastic volatility
```

## What's here

- `bs.py` - Interactive Black-Scholes simulation with sliders
- `heston.py` - Interactive Heston model with stochastic variance
- `heston.md` - Implementation notes and theory
